Empowering Communities. Inspiring Change

Why was Unity to Serve founded?

Unity to Serve was founded to uplift Afghan refugee families—especially women—rebuilding their lives in California amid significant challenges such as language barriers, limited work experience, and lack of support. Since 2021, thousands of Afghan families have made California their home, bringing resilience, hope, and determination to create brighter futures. Yet many women remain excluded from economic opportunity due to limited English proficiency, minimal U.S. job experience, and fragile support systems. Language gaps and a labor market favoring fluent speakers often prevent them from entering the workforce. Our mission extends beyond any single group. We proudly serve a diverse range of underserved and marginalized communities across California, including American-born individuals, immigrants, refugees, and Asian communities. Unity to Serve transforms these challenges into opportunities. Through targeted job placement, skills development, mentorship, and comprehensive community support, we empower women to thrive, lead, and contribute meaningfully to their communities. Backed by a dedicated team and committed partners, we are building inclusive, thriving communities where every family is valued, supported, and empowered to succeed.

Our goal is to empower refugees, educate Afghan women, and uplift communities by building bridges for rising, rebuilding, and leading.

Our mandate is to empower Afghan women through equitable employment, capacity building, and entrepreneurship promoting self-reliance, leadership, and lasting economic inclusion.

We prioritize hiring Afghan women with limited English and job experience, offering them a first step into the U.S. workforce.

We empower our employees with skills to become confident leaders, independent and self-sufficient.

We support aspiring women entrepreneurs to launch small businesses and become self-reliant in American society.

Join us in creating lasting impact through education, inclusion, and opportunity.

Creating inclusive educational opportunities that uplift individuals and strengthen communities.

Providing essential resources and pathways for refugees to heal, grow, and flourish in new beginnings.

Ensuring equal access to technology and digital literacy for underserved populations in a connected world.

Advocating for equal rights, opportunities, and respect—regardless of gender—so everyone can thrive.

Our initiatives empower individuals and communities to build brighter, more sustainable futures.

At Unity to Serve International, we make it simple for you to spark real change. By empowering communities through education, technology, and inclusion, your support creates lasting impact—where it’s needed most.

Unity to Serve International is a newly established organization in the United States; however, its foundation is deeply rooted in the work of Women Integrity for Society Empowerment (WISE), originally founded in Afghanistan in 2012. The founder of Unity to Serve International also led and founded WISE, which had a strong mandate focused on empowering women and fresh university graduates with no prior work experience.

WISE was committed to building the capacity of young women, promoting leadership, and advocating for women’s rights. Over the years, the organization successfully implemented eight impactful projects in key areas including women’s rights advocacy, vocational training, education, and health. By prioritizing skill development and providing access to essential services, WISE played a vital role in empowering marginalized communities.

Though our name and location have evolved, our mission remains unchanged. Unity to Serve International continues the legacy of WISE—championing women’s empowerment, supporting underserved populations, and fostering sustainable, community-driven development. We remain dedicated to creating opportunities and lasting impact through advocacy, education, and inclusive growth.

We implement the following strategies

United States, with a Focus on California

At Unity to Serve International we focus our efforts in two key regions where our work can have the greatest impact

In the U.S., particularly in California, we address challenges related to gender inequality, education access, and digital inclusion. We collaborate with local communities to empower women and girls, enhance educational opportunities, and bridge the digital divide for underserved populations.

In Afghanistan, we work to support education transformation, social inclusion, and refugee assistance. Our initiatives focus on empowering women and girls, providing critical education access, and fostering resilience in communities affected by displacement and conflict.

Through advocacy, collaboration, and innovation, our work transforms lives, strengthens communities, and drives meaningful change worldwide.

At Unity to Serve International, we believe that systemic change begins with empowering individuals and fostering equitable opportunities for all. Our Theory of Change is rooted in the idea that addressing barriers to education, inclusion, and access can create ripple effects that transform communities and societies.

By addressing the root causes of inequality, lack of education, and digital exclusion, we aim to create a world where every individual can thrive, contribute, and lead. Our work fosters sustainable change by empowering communities and building a foundation for a more equitable and inclusive future.
